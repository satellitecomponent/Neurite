## `Introduction`

### 💡 **[neurite.network](https://satellitecomponent.github.io/Neurite/) unleashes a new dimension of digital interface...**

### **...the fractal dimension.**

## Bridging Fractals and Thought

🧩 **Drawing from chaos theory and graph theory, Neurite unveils the hidden patterns and intricate connections that shape creative thinking.**

For over a year, we've been iterating out a virtually limitless workspace that blends the mesmerizing complexity of fractals with contemporary mind mapping technique.

      <h3><code>Why Fractals?</code></h3>
      <p>The Mandelbrot Set is not just an aesthetic choice - fractal logic is ingrained into a countless number of natural and constructed phenomena - from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RdOwhmqP5s">polynomial equations</a>, to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/20833">art</a> and <a href="https://www.mpg.de/9379548/fractals-set-the-tone">music</a> - even the <a href="https://cosmicweb.kimalbrecht.com/">cosmic web</a>.</p>
      <p>🌀 Fractals act as the cross-disciplinary framework for non-integer dimensional thought - where conventional notions of 4D spacetime are put into question.</p>
      <p>The goal of this project is to grow agentic graphs of fractal creativity & collaboration.</p>

### First of its Kind Fractal Zoom

[neurite.network](https://satellitecomponent.github.io/Neurite/) is unique in its ability to seamlessly navigate the Mandelbrot set in real time! 🚀

Movements through the fractal are no longer interrupted at each step. Instead, the rendering persists and regenerates as you interact...

### `Why Nodes?`
### Nodes represent text, images, videos, code, and AI agents. Together, they thread a personalized microcosm of your thoughts and inspirations. 🔭

[neurite.network](https://satellitecomponent.github.io/Neurite/) connects physics simulation of graphs with an underlying fractal topology to kinematically define interactive, iterative, and modular graphs of ideation.

## `Complexity Inspires Creativity / Basins Attract`
### Whether you're a researcher, writer, artist, developer, educator, or simply a curious thinker, Neurite offers a departure from the conventional interface. It's an interactive landscape tracing your ever-branching pathways of thought.

## `How to Use Neurite`

### 📚 [Neurite](https://satellitecomponent.github.io/Neurite/) lets you embed anything - text, photos, audio, video, PDFs, AI, and webpages - directly within the Mandelbrot set. 

 `Drag and drop` or `Paste` local files and web content straight into the fractal.

Custom `## title` and `[[reference]]` tags can be set in the Zettelkasten Settings. To access the Zettelkasten Settings, click the note icon in the top left corner of the dropdown.

  *Full controls are listed in the ? tab within Neurite's main dropdown.
  
`UI Tips`
- Optimal Node Placement: Zoom in `Scroll` to create space for new nodes to ensure they have room to expand.
- Managing Windows: Drag windows by their title bar and resize by scrolling while holding `Shift`.
- Freezing Nodes: Hold `Shift` to freeze nodes in place, then double click the nodes to anchor them in place.
- Ai Tutorial: The HOW-TO checkbox sends a context message to the AI that allows it to answer some questions about Neurite.

        <li><strong>Graph your AI Conversations:</strong> Segment AI's responses into a cohesive web of thought that both improves AI reasoning and allows for the history of your chain of thought to dynamically construct the Ai's memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive Fractal Network:</strong> Neurite's fractal interface acts as a personal, emergent, and contextually aware database of knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Note Navigation:</strong> Effortlessly access and pull your notes into view, no matter where they are within the fractal landscape.</li>

## `User Guide`
### To run Neurite locally,
either:  
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the index.html file in your browser (note: local AI features will not be enabled)  

Or, to enable local AI features without using our Github pages host above:  
1. Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal (either main or local-ai branch)
2. Install any necessary global dependencies when running the below, (Vite)

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## `Local Server Setup`

The Localhost Servers are an important component of Neurite that serves as an optional backend for complelte functionality.

### Download Localhost Servers [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/satellitecomponent/Neurite/tree/main/Localhost%20Servers).

### The servers enable plugin integration for webpage/pdf text extraction, Wolfram Alpha, and Wikipedia.
- The localhost servers require npm and Node.js
- Without any servers running, Wolfram, Wiki, and Webpage extractions will not function.
- All servers can be run with one command. Download the Localhost Servers folder, or find it in your cloned directory. Once navigated to the Localhost Servers folder in your command line, run
```
  node start_servers.js
```
This will run all of the servers at once. They'll work on our Github pages host of Neurite, or any other way you locally access the interface.

As of our recent update, the servers now support an Ai proxy that connects Neurite to any inference backend.

### `Final Notes`
- Search: Our distinctive search mechanism transports you through your intricate web of thoughts, directly zooming to the node you are looking for. The navigational experience isn't just a gimmick; it also helps to reinforce the spatial memory of where that piece of information resides within the larger framework.
- Saving: Your networks can be saved within the browser cache, or downloaded as a .txt file. Drag the .txt file into the save box, click load on the imported file, then click the second load button to display the network. 💾 Saving has been significantly enchanced! Now, node interactivity, fractal settings, and the Zettelkasten sync all fully restore when loading networks from the save tab...
- Zettelkasten and Mind Mapping: Create nodes through custom-defined syntax, or create nodes through UI interaction within our fractal workspace, who's contents are bi-directionally linked to the main Zettelkasten document.
- Fractals: We achieve real-time navigation of the Mandelbrot set by capturing a sparse set of points from the fractal and connecting them through SVGs. From there, we dynamically adapt the level of detail based on your viewport and cursor position.  This evolving method is what ensures seamless fractal generation, interaction, as well as an expanding array of customizability options.

Neurite realizes tapestry of thought reasoning for Ai, all within our innovative real-time Mandelbrot visualization.
- Talk to the custom GPT, [Neurite GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-OT9IVbW8H-neurite) with access to Neurite's code and readme. (This is not the ai that interacts with Neurite itself)

      <ul>
        <li>Animate movements through the Mandelbrot set</li>
        <li>Determine exact coordinates to zoom to</li>
        <li>Call GPT 4 Vision to determine the next movement (set number of iterations)</li>
        <li>Create notes</li>
        <li>Prompt the Zettelkasten Ai</li>
        <li>Prompt the user</li>
        <li>Search and Zoom to Notes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can call on GPT to construct the sequences of function calls itself. It has access to the documentation.</p>
      <p>For the current documentation, try calling the below from within the function panel:</p>
      <pre><code>const neuralAPI = neuralApiPrompt();
console.log(neuralAPI);</code></pre>
      <p>The current Neural API documentation will display in your call history for the function calling panel as well as in your browser console.</p>
      <p>There will be more information on this soon. This is a new feature in initial release.</p>
